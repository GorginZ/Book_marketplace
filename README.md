**Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your App**

**Active Record** associations perform a number of critical high level functinos behind the scenes in my application. The declared associations between my active record models allow me to use the methods added to my models by these associations to manipuate objects in my database. One basic example is the dependent: :destroy association, which establishes a relation between one model and another, in my case Listings belongs_to :user.  This declared association means if a user is deleted the other objects in Listings model that are dependent on that user  are destroyed, which helps maintain order in the database and prevent orphaned listings.

Another useful example of how high level active record funcitons help my app run are the methods that come with the has_one_attached association. Listings and Category objects has_one_attached :picture. This association provides me with a scope I can call on those objects when I query the database to grab the pictures in my controller to feed to my views. I can call 

```
    @listings = Listing.where(available: true).with_attached_picture.all.limit(100)

```

in my show, and the with_attached_picture scope that comes along with the has_one_attached association allows me to reduce my database queries, because there is that association declared in my model.

The active record associations that exist between my models mean that when users create or edit listings, for instance if they edit the category of a listing, because of the active record association that exists between Listing and Category, the object is correctly updated in the database by SQL commands that will run when the edit action is executed.

Active recodrd associations are what allow for proper dynamic interaction and smooth operation and updating of my objects in reference and with respect to the appropriate relations and associations that need to exist for funcitnoality. 



A second example **Active Storage**, follows on from Active Record associations, as the scopes and methods discussed above allows me to access Active Storage attachments. I use active storage attachments to allow users to upload images through Amazon S3. Their uploads become associated with the object they are attaching it to and are able to be queried thorugh that association. The attachment is not in the database table like other attributes of a Listing like title, price etc, however. The way it works is this:  Active storage attachments create a polymorphic join table. It uses two tables, active_storage blobs and active_storage_attachments and it is through this association it is able to attach the file to the record. The SQL it spits out is like so: 

```
ActiveStorage::Attachment Load (0.5ms)  SELECT "active_storage_attachments".* FROM "active_storage_attachments" WHERE "active_storage_attachments"."record_type" = $1 AND "active_storage_attachments"."name" = $2 AND "active_storage_attachments"."record_id" IN ($3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, $12, $13, $14, $15, $16, $17, $18, $19)
```

My config/environments/test.rb is configured such that my active_storage service is amazon as opposed to local, and so when an image is attached Active Storage generates URL for the file using access keys for the S3 bucket associated with my app.

**Action View**

Action views compiles the views associated with the actions in the controller it is associated to. Each controller will have it's own associated folder within the views directory, which allows for routing to and rendering of those views.

The views include templates, layouts and partials. Partials are handy and are htm.erb files that can be rendered in multiple views throughout the app. Temploates are directly associated with an action and must be routed correctly to render. The layouts allow us to specify certain view specifications perhaps for the whole application - as in the application.html.erb file, such as rendering a nav bar, or different views for different users, whether they are logged in or not etc. 



**Detail any third party services that your App will use**

I set up a S3 bucket with Amazon Webservices which is associated with my app. I configured my config/environments/production.rb as active_storage service = amazon, so my live heroku app allows files to be attached to certain records and is able to access those files through the active storage associations set up in my models. This is also discussed in some detail above. 

An additional third party service/gem I utilised is stripe. Like AWS I had to configure this with my accounts master and secret keys. The stripe gem allows for mock/test card transactions in my app and in my payments_controller I followed stripe documentation for how to correctly pass the object params and stripe session ID. The metadata stripe uses to associate the transaction to the user is the current user's user_id and the listing in question's listing_id. I also created a second webhook endpoint so that stripe functions correctly in my deployed heroku app, as I noticed although stripe said everything was sucessful, the logic in my webhook was not executing, the listing was not renderd unavailable and the order was not created. This was a simple fix, though as I revised the documentation I simply needed to create an additional endpoint. Now my webhook action succesfully performs sql commands in my live app as well as locally - which saves the listings attribute available as false and it is no longer listed as an available listing, and also creates an order object associated with the listing id, and the user id of the buyer. 

Stipe and the logic associated with the webhook endpoint is essential for my apps full functionality and helps me manipulate data to appropiately reflect the intentions and uses of buyers and sellers using my app.

Likewise AWS provides a critical function by allowing users to add listings to advertise their listings visually.



Identify the problem youâ€™re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?

| R1   | Create your *app* using Ruby on **Rails**.                   |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| R2   | Use **Postgresql** database in development and production.   |
| R3   | Your *app* will have authentication (eg. Devise).            |
| R4   | Your *app* will have authorisation (i.e. users have restrictions on what they can see and edit). |
| R5   | Your *app* will have some type of file (eg. images) uploading capability. |
| R6   | Your *app* is to be deployed to Heroku (recommended) or AWS. |

R3. My app uses the devise Gem for authentication. 



**R4. Authorization**

I used cancancan for authorisation. An example of how this helped me create different restrictions for users with regard to what they can see and edit etc. is the restrictred access to *Category* methods. Only Admin users can use C R U D methods on Categories. This is because the categories that exist are what users will select from when they create a listing when they declare the category of their listing, so it's important they are not duplicated. The category primary key is the foreign key for the listing, allowing  The Category model exists mostly to ensure with easy browsing, and so if Admins are able to edit and add categories accordingly, to do with popularity or to accomidate for certain types of listings, this is a good way to make that easy to manage. 
With regards to moderation, it also means that admins can remove or edit anything inappropriate or correct errors.

R6. I deployed my app through heroku initially after creating it. I utilised auto-deploy so my app was built after each push to my master on my github Repo. 

User Stories

as a student I'm generally pressed for cash, and university compulsory text books are expensive. Often students use university social Facebook groups to sell text books and have to meet up on campus at the beginning or end of semester. A web app that creates a forum where users can list and buy from across the country and send and receive texts by post opens this up for wider accessability to second hand texts.
Users:

- I want to be able to brows the app easily to explore the features available before creating an account and signing up
- I want my account to be easily manageable with options to change or update my password and change any key information
- I want to feel confident my information and privacy is being treated appropriately and in accordance with laws around personal information such as handling of credit card details and my contact details and only hand over information that is necessary for my own use of the services ( for example, assurance that my password or card details are handled by a trusted third party group that I can read about if I choose )
- be able to lodge grievances or get help in the instance something doesn't work out for me

When selling:

- I want simple listing forms so I can easily add a listing's title, author and category
- I want to easily manage and view my listings
- I want to be notified if someone has bought my listing
- I want to be able to communicate with buyer
- I want to be able to list pick-up options, incase the buyer is local and that is preferable

When purchasing:

- I want to be able to easily brows for texts and see what is available before making an account
- I want a search function
-  I want to be able to communicate with who I am buying from
- I want a basic level of protection when purchasing, I want to be able to raise an issue with an administrator if I did not recieve an item or have an issue, if I am unable to resolve this with the seller I'd like to know I may be able to make a complaint or have an issue resolved with support.
